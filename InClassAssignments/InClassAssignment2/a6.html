        <p class="verse">
            My heart a storm, clouds raging deep within
            The Prince of peace came bursting through the wind
            The violent sky held its breath
            And in Your light I found rest
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
            Your love surrounds me when my thoughts wage war
            When night screams terror, there Your voice will roar
            Come death or shadow, God I know Your light will meet me there
            
            When fear comes knocking, there You'll be my guard
            When day breeds trouble, there You'll hold my heart
            Come storm or battle, God I know Your peace will meet me there
        </p>
